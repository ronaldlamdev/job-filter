This is my solution to the Job Filter challenge from Frontend Mentor using React TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
This was a 3rd attempt to practice incorporating TypeScript into my projects. After using TypeScript for a while,
I don't think I can go back to plain old JavaScript though I still need practice and more understanding of the former.

#Challenges faced 
-How to use TypeScript with React Context (though I learned how to do this, I found this unneccessary for this project)
-How to pass a conditional in a prop (for determining when to create a NEW! or FEATURED! tag if it exists in an element of an array)
-How to use the spread operator to create a new array
-How to use every method to check if all elements in an array exists

#What I like to learn more/improve on
-Better understanding how TypeScript works such as what is Interface
-Learn more advanced React Topics
-Improve readibility of code like shortening a list of utility classes into a single custom class
-Learn a new Framework like Chakra UI or Next JS
